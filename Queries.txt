Question 1: Who is the best customer?
The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Build a query that returns the person who has spent the most money. The Solution can be found by linking the following three: Invoice, Invoice Line, and Customer tables to retrieve this information

SELECT
  c.CustomerId,
  c.FirstName,
  c.LastName,
  SUM(total) Total_invoices
FROM Customer c
JOIN Invoice i
  ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
GROUP BY 1,
         2,
         3
ORDER BY 4 DESC;

Question 2: Who is writing the rock music?

Now that we know that our customers love rock music, we can decide which musicians to invite to play at the concert.

SELECT
  a.ArtistId,
  a.Name,
  COUNT(*) songs
FROM Artist a
JOIN Album al
  ON a.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
JOIN Track t
  ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN Genre g
  ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
WHERE g.Name = 'Rock'
GROUP BY 1,
         2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;

Question 3.1 First, find which artist has earned the most according to the Invoice Lines?

SELECT
  ar.Name,
  SUM(il.UnitPrice) AS amount_spent
FROM InvoiceLine il
JOIN Track t
  ON il.TrackId = t.TrackId
JOIN Album al
  ON t.AlbumId = AL.AlbumId
JOIN Artist ar
  ON al.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;



Question 3.2 Now use this artist to find which customer spent the most on this artist.

SELECT
  c.CustomerId,
  c.FirstName,
  c.LastName,
  ar.Name,
  SUM(il.Quantity * il.UnitPrice) AmountSpent
FROM Invoice i
JOIN InvoiceLine il
  ON i.InvoiceId = il.InvoiceId
JOIN Track t
  ON il.TrackId = t.TrackId
JOIN Customer c
  ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
JOIN Album al
  ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
JOIN Artist ar
  ON al.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
WHERE ar.Name = 'Iron Maiden'
GROUP BY 1,
         2,
         3,
         4
ORDER BY 5 DESC;




Question 4
a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. they query returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent. For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount.

WITH total_spent_table
AS (SELECT
  c.FirstName,
  c.LastName,
  c.Country,
  c.CustomerId,
  SUM(i.total) AS sum_invoices
FROM Customer c
JOIN Invoice i
  ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY i.CustomerId)

SELECT
  total_spent_table.*
FROM Total_spent_table
LEFT JOIN (SELECT
  CustomerId,
  FirstName,
  LastName,
  Country,
  MAX(sum_invoices) AS MaxInvoices
FROM total_spent_table
GROUP BY Country) Max_spent_table

  ON Total_spent_table.Country = Max_spent_table.Country
WHERE total_spent_table.sum_invoices = Max_spent_table.MaxInvoices
ORDER BY Country;
